fired her weapon at Rueda because she feared that he , too , was coming to attack her . </s> <s> Police searched her purse , finding a gun and fifty shells , and then the couple 's room at Hotel Gin ,

country illegally and carrying an unlicensed gun . </s> <s> The gun found in the couple 's room that night was later proven through ballistics to be the same gun that killed Patricia Jones in 1960 , but because Sharon had already been acquitted of that crime , she could not be charged again for it based on the new evidence . </s> <s> Pugliese was held at the Palacio de Lecumberri , while Sharon was initially placed in a women 's prison before being transferred to Lecumberri for her trial . </s> <s> The couple were arraigned on September 26 and held for trial . </s> <s> In October , Sharon 's attorney , Higinio Lara , filed a recurso de amparo , similar to a writ of habeas corpus , asserting that Mexico was violating her constitutional rights by holding her for a shooting committed in self-defense . </s> <s> The request was denied and both Kinne and Pugliese were tried in the summer of 1965 . </s> <s> Pugliese , cleared of the charges against him , was deported to the U.S. , but

prison term for the crimes . </s> <s> When she was officially notified of the sentence the next day , she asserted that she would appeal her conviction . </s> <s> The appeal , rather than overturning her sentence , lengthened it . </s> <s> The three-man superior court which heard her case overturned one aspect of her conviction—charges of attempted robbery—but upheld her murder conviction and

Investigation showed that a door that should have been locked had been left unsecured Further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been . </s> <s> News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Sharon 's escape , including that she had bribed prison guards , that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman , that her mother had been involved in the escape plan , that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in the escape , and that Sharon may have disguised herself as a man to effect her escape . </s> <s> A more modern theory speculates that Ordoñez 's family had helped her escape and then killed her .

longer involved in searching for the escaped prisoner , while the federal district attorney was reporting that responsibility for the hunt belonged to the city district attorney 's office . </s> <s> Investigators speculated that Sharon had already crossed the border from Mexico into Guatemala , mooting the purpose of a Mexican manhunt . </s> <s> They noted that she was fluent in Spanish after her years in Mexican prison , and she could therefore `` get along rather well '' in nearly any Spanish-speaking area of the world . </s> <s> Despite vowing to keep the case open and their investigation running until Sharon was back in custody , authorities were forced to admit by the end of December 1969 that they had run out of investigative leads to pursue . </s> <s> More than forty years after

entanglements . </s> <s> Because she was being held in Mexico on October 26 , 1964—the scheduled date for her fourth trial in the murder of her husband—her $ 25,000 bond was revoked on that date .

Supreme Court , but when that court upheld the bond 's forfeiture , the $ 25,000 was paid to the State of Missouri in October 1965 . </s> <s> The United Bond Insurance Company later filed suit against Sharon 's family to recover the cost of the bail , lawyer 's fees , and searching for Sharon after her escape . </s> <s> Shortly before her scheduled Missouri trial date , Sharon 's Missouri counsel filed a motion to change the venue of any eventual fourth trial in the death of James Kinne , claiming that news coverage of Sharon 's cases had so prejudiced residents of Jackson County against her that it would be impossible for her to get a fair trial there . </s> <s> When Sharon failed to appear for the murder of her husband , a warrant was issued for her arrest in October 1964 . </s> <s> It is still outstanding 54 years later—making it the oldest outstanding murder warrant known to exist in the Kansas City area . </s> <s> Sharon 's status in the Mexican system also remains outstanding ,

outstanding sentence . </s> <s> In a segment of the Investigation Discovery series Deadly Women covering the Kinne case , author James Hays speculates that Sharon Kinne committed her first murder for monetary gain , hoping to cash in on James 's life insurance policy , and that she began to derive pleasure from killing at that point . </s> <s> Former FBI profiler Candice DeLong supports this assertion , stating that Sharon is a sociopath , lacking in remorse and empathy , and therefore had no compunction about killing to get what she wanted . </s> <s> This idea is echoed by some of those involved in prosecuting Sharon . </s> <s> Even those who believe in her guilt , however , note that she had a certain appeal , describing her as `` rather attractive '' and admitting that they grew to like her . </s> <s> The Mammoth Book of True Crime describes her as a relative rarity , a `` pretty '' criminal . </s> <s> In I 'm Just an Ordinary Girl : The Sharon Kinne Story , Hays asserts that

1982 , Olson pleaded guilty to 11 counts of murder and was given as many concurrent life sentences to be served in Canada 's super-maximum security Special Handling Unit in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines ,

being the notorious serial killer , Jack the Ripper . </s> <s> Deeming was born in Ashby-de-la-Zouch , Leicestershire , England , son of Thomas Deeming , brazier , and his wife Ann , née Bailey . </s> <s> He was a `` difficult child '' according to writers Maurice Gurvich and Christopher Wray . </s> <s> At 16 years of age , he ran away to sea , and thereafter he began a long career of crime , largely thieving and obtaining money under false pretenses . </s> <s> He was also responsible for the murder of his first wife Marie and his four children at Rainhill , England , on or about 26 July 1891 , and a second wife , Emily Mather , at Windsor , Melbourne , on 24 December 1891 . </s> <s> Less than three months elapsed between the discovery of Mather 's body in Windsor , Melbourne , in March 1892 , and Deeming 's execution for her murder in May 1892 ; a remarkably short time by comparison to modern western legal standards . </s> <s> This was not only due to efficient police work , but also a result of the considerable international media interest the murder attracted . </s> <s> For example , it was an English journalist working for the Melbourne Argus who first approached Mather 's mother in Rainhill and delivered the news of her daughter 's murder . </s> <s> [ nb 1 ] Another factor was Deeming 's behaviour in public , for while he often used different names , he usually drew attention to himself with behaviour variously described as aggressive , ostentatious , ingratiating and overly attentive to women . </s> <s> Police investigations after his arrest in 1892 revealed that Deeming had moved to Australia in 1882 , chiefly working in Sydney , but also working for John Danks , a Melbourne importer of plumbing and gas fitting supplies . </s> <s> His Melbourne employers regarded him as an excellent worker and extended him 200 pounds credit , supposedly to open a business in Rockhampton , Queensland . </s> <s> The money was never repaid . </s> <s> Deeming is known to have worked for a Sydney gasfitter , where he was charged with theft of brass fittings from his employer . </s> <s> Deeming indignantly denied the theft , but the items were found at his home and he was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment . </s> <s> Deeming pretended to faint when the sentence was pronounced . </s> <s> After his release , he continued to work in Sydney as a gasfitter until , in December 1887 , he was again committed for trial , now on a charge of fraudulent insolvency . </s> <s> He disappeared from New South Wales while on bail . </s> <s> Deeming was accompanied by his wife while in Australia , `` a typical Welsh lass , '' Marie , née James . </s> <s> Deeming had married her in Lower Tranmere , England in February 1881 and they had lived briefly at Birkenhead before

his brothers Alfred and Walter learned that Deeming and his family were returning to England `` with a considerable fortune '' . </s> <s> Later police and newspaper research discovered Deeming had been active in Cape Town , South Africa in 1888–1889 , but his exact movements at this time are unclear and it appears he returned to Birkenhead , England , at least once . </s> <s> Marie had another child at this time . </s> <s> [ nb 2 ] He was known to have been involved in conducting a Transvaal diamond mine swindle in 1889 . </s> <s> His return to England via the steamship Yumna was well remembered by the Captain and passengers because of his ostentatious display of jewelry and money , and his unwanted attention to some of the female passengers . </s> <s> He had arrived at Hull by November 1889 , lodging in the nearby town of Beverley . </s> <s> Here he passed himself off as `` a retired sheep farmer '' named Harry Lawson from Mount House Farm , Rockhampton , Queensland , living on 1,500 pounds a year . </s> <s> He wooed Helen Matheson , the 21-year-old daughter of his landlady and married her , bigamously , on 18 February 1890 . </s> <s> About a month later , after a honeymoon in the south of England , he suddenly disappeared , taking his expensive gifts to Matheson with him . </s> <s> Deeming 's wife and extended family had heard of his bigamous marriage to Matheson according to Gurvich and Wray . </s> <s> Deeming was later found to have then visited Marie and his ( now ) four children in Birkenhead . </s> <s> He apparently gave Marie several hundred pounds and announced he was leaving for South America . </s> <s> He would send for her and the children once he was settled . </s> <s> Before leaving he conducted another swindle at a jeweler 's in Hull . </s> <s> He was arrested for this on arrival at Montevideo and extradited back to England on a charge of `` obtaining goods by false pretenses '' being sentenced to nine months prison . </s> <s> On his release from prison in July 1891 , Deeming headed to the Liverpool area , settling into a hotel in the village of Rainhill , Merseyside under the name Albert Williams . </s> <s> A mysterious woman ( almost certainly his wife Marie ) who appeared at the hotel was dismissed as his `` sister '' , visiting before she left for Port Said . </s> <s> Deeming then took a lease on Dinham Villa , a house in Rainhill , supposedly on behalf of a military friend , a certain `` Colonel Brookes '' . </s> <s> However , Deeming himself took up residence at Dinham Villa , while a woman and several children were seen at the house and were again dismissed as merely his `` sister and her children '' visiting , who had `` since returned home '' . </s> <s> Shortly afterward , Deeming complained that the drains at Dinham Villa were defective , and the kitchen floor needed to be replaced . </s> <s> He closely supervised the work on the floor . </s> <s> While in Rainhill , Deeming began to court Emily Lydia Mather , the daughter of a widowed local shopkeeper , Mrs. Dove Mather . </s> <s> Mather and Deeming ( as Albert Williams ) married on 22 September 1891 . </s> <s> In November 1891 , Deeming ( still using the name Williams ) took Mather to Australia in the German steamship Kaiser Wilhelm II . </s> <s> They arrived in Melbourne on 15 December 1891 . </s> <s> Deeming rented a house on Andrew Street in Windsor , a suburb of Melbourne . </s> <s> On 24 December or early on 25 December 1891 , he murdered Mather and buried her under the hearthstone of one of the bedrooms , covering the body with cement . </s> <s> He had paid a month 's rent in advance , giving the name Mr. Drewn , but almost immediately left the property . </s> <s> The owner , nearby butcher John Stamford , had been happy to rent to the man , because of his air of respectability , and at first , had not even known the man 's name . </s> <s> On 3 March 1892 a prospective tenant of the Windsor house complained of `` a disagreeable smell '' in the second bedroom . </s> <s> The owner and estate agent later raised the hearthstone to investigate whereupon the smell became so overpowering `` they found themselves barely able to breathe '' . </s> <s> The police were called and Mather 's body found . </s> <s> A postmortem conducted on 4 March found that although her skull had been fractured by several blows , the most likely cause of death was that her throat had been cut . </s> <s> Publicity surrounding the gruesome finding of Mather 's body was considerable . </s> <s> Within a few days , The Age newspaper had connected the murder to the Whitechapel murders of London : </s> <s> From the outset a suspicion of insanity is almost suggested and a tinge of the Whitechapel murders is hinted . </s> <s> The body hacked and mangled , the cool manner in which the cementing was carried out , the taking a house etc , the laborious obliteration of all traces of the crime – all these things suggest the malevolence and craft which can scarcely accompany the sane murderer , no matter how callous and brutal . </s> <s> From clues found at the vacant Andrew Street house and from information provided by local tradespeople , including Stamford and his agent , a local laundress , an ironmonger who sold Deeming cement and several carriers , investigating Victoria Police sergeants William Considine and Henry Cawsey were able to trace the recently arrived Mr. Williams to the Kaiser Wilhelm II . </s> <s> They were then able to interview other passengers , who gave corroborating descriptions of Mr. Williams and Mather . </s> <s> In the weeks at sea , Mather had talked to other passengers of her family at Rainhill , and the connection was now made . </s> <s> Deeming 's behaviour as Mr. Williams had also attracted considerable attention during the voyage . </s> <s> Many passengers stated they `` detested Williams , [ but ] all agreed he had treated his wife in a loving and considerate manner '' . </s> <s> Police now also had a very good description of Mr. Williams , which they circulated to other Australian colonies , but at this stage , his real identity was still unknown . </s> <s> At an inquest held on 8 March , it was discovered that a man answering Mr. Williams 's description had auctioned a variety of household goods , possibly wedding presents , in the city in early January 1892 . </s> <s> At this time he was staying at the Cathedral Hotel in Swanston Street , Melbourne , registered as Mr. Duncan . </s> <s> It later transpired that Deeming had also written an affectionate letter ( as Albert Williams ) to Mather 's mother several days after Mather 's murder . </s> <s> Deeming had found time to approach Holt 's Matrimonial Agency ( as Duncan ) , wishing to meet a young lady with matrimonial intentions . </s> <s> He had also found time to swindle a local Melbourne jeweller . </s> <s> In the meantime , on or about 12 January 1892 , Deeming had travelled to Sydney , and was now using the name Baron Swanston . </s> <s> During the voyage and in Sydney Deeming met and courted Kate Rounsefell . </s> <s> He told Rounsefell that if she agreed to become his wife , `` she would never regret it , and would always congratulate herself on having entered into matrimony with him '' . </s> <s> After a whirlwind romance , during which Deeming gave Rounsefell several items of what was later shown to be stolen Melbourne jewellery , Rounsefell consented to marry Baron Swanston . </s> <s> Having also agreed to follow him to Western Australia , Rounsefell and Deeming parted company . </s> <s> By means of forged testimonials , Deeming had obtained a position at a mine at Southern Cross . </s> <s> On 22 January 1892 Baron Swanston departed for Fremantle . </s> <s> Again , Deeming as Baron Swanston made a name for himself on the ship , boasting of his wealth and position in society . </s> <s> He made approaches to Miss Maude Beech , a young woman in the care of her uncle and aunt , Mr. and Mrs. Wakeley . </s> <s> In this case , Deeming 's charm came to nothing . </s> <s> Mr. Wakeley told Swanston ; `` I may tell you plainly , that I do n't believe your stories and I am not in the habit of allowing men of your class to enter my family circle . </s> <s> `` Once settled at Southern Cross , Deeming maintained a barrage of pleas to Rounsefell , writing on 8 February ; `` Do n't keep me waiting dear . </s> <s> If you love me half as much as I love you , you would not keep me waiting a day '' . </s> <s> [ nb 3 ] </s> <s> Police were closing in , however , and following telegrams by Victoria Police to Western Australia , Deeming was arrested at Southern Cross on 12 March 1892 . </s> <s> He began by denying he was Deeming but later said `` I think I know the party who has been murdered . </s> <s> I do n't believe anyone would have the heart to murder a girl like that '' . </s> <s> Found in his possession at the time of the arrest were a number of Mather 's belongings , including her prayer book . </s> <s> At about the same time Deeming was being returned to Melbourne , news of the discovery of the Rainhill murders in England arrived in Australia . </s> <s> Following publicity surrounding the discovery of Mather 's body at Windsor , investigations at Rainhill revealed the decomposing bodies of Marie Deeming and the four children ; Bertha ( aged 10 ) , Mary ( 7 ) , Sidney ( 5 ) and Leala ( 18 months ) buried beneath the re-concreted floor of Dinham Villa . </s> <s> The throats of most had been cut ( Bertha had been strangled ) . </s> <s> The murder and burials had apparently occurred while Deeming ( as Albert Williams ) was courting Mather , on or about 26 July 1891 . </s> <s> At an inquest held at Rainhill on 18 March 1892 , Deeming 's brothers identified Marie and gave some accounts of his activities . </s> <s> The Rainhill murders had gone undetected for eight months . </s> <s> It appears Deeming 's brothers and Marie 's sister had been led to believe that Marie and the children were in Brighton on a holiday and then assumed they were overseas again . </s> <s> Deeming had made several visits to Birkenhead to reassure Martha that her sister and the children were well . </s> <s> Detection of the murders was also obstructed by Deeming 's lease ( as Williams ) on Dinham Villa , which stipulated that the house should not be sold or relet for six months , because of the imminent arrival of Colonel Brookes and/or Williams ' sister . </s> <s> The lease also allowed Williams to resurface the concrete floor . </s> <s> Furious demonstrations against Deeming were made on the journey to Perth , and again on the way to Albany . </s> <s> Deeming was tried at Melbourne Supreme Court on 25 April 1892 . </s> <s> The prosecution case was conducted by Robert Walsh , Q.C . </s> <s> Alfred Deakin , his counsel , tried to mount a plea of insanity . </s> <s> The defence also questioned the impact of newspaper reporting of Deeming on the jury . </s> <s> Perhaps wishing to aid the defence of insanity , Deeming also claimed to have caught syphilis in London and to have received visitations from his mother 's spirit , which urged his actions . </s> <s> Before the jury retired , Deeming made a `` lengthy , ... rambling , speech of self-justification . '' </s> <s> He repeated a story he had told police that Emily had `` run off with another man '' . </s> <s> `` That is my one comfort ... knowing that she is not dead '' . </s> <s> Deeming was found guilty as charged , however . </s> <s> Deeming spent the last days writing his autobiography and poetry ; `` The Jury listened well to the yarn I had to tell , But they sent me straight to hell . </s> <s> `` He also spent time talking to the Church of England ministers , to whom he supposedly confessed . </s> <s> The sentence of the court was confirmed by the Executive Council on 9 May 1892 and the judicial committee of the Privy Council refused leave to appeal on 19 May 1892 . </s> <s> Deeming was hanged at 10:01 am on 23 May 1892 , he weighed 143 pounds ( 65 kg ) , 14 pounds ( 6.4 kg ) less than when he entered prison . </s> <s> The autobiography which Deeming wrote in jail was destroyed . </s> <s> A family acquaintance of the Mather family , Edward Thunderbolt , Melbourne 's Inspector of Public Nuisances , arranged a public subscription , and erected a monument to Emily Mather at Melbourne General Cemetery . </s> <s> [ nb 4 ] </s> <s> As Australians struggled to comprehend the savageness of the Windsor murder , significant press speculation grew , suggesting Deeming was Jack the Ripper . </s> <s> The speculation was also found in overseas reports of the case . </s> <s> For example , on 17 March 1892 The New York Times reported the story with the headlines : </s> <s> Perhaps Jack the Ripper . </s> <s> The Startling discovery made in Liverpool . </s> <s> A Man arrested in Australia . </s> <s> Deeming 's movements at many stages of his career are obscure , but it appears he may have been in England in late 1888 , the time of the Whitechapel murders . </s> <s> Kreitmayer 's Melbourne waxworks of 1912 probably reflected widespread public opinion when it depicted in wax Deeming burying Mather , commenting that it was suspected he was `` identical with Jack the Ripper '' . </s> <s> Speculation that Deeming was Jack the Ripper continues today and Robin Napper a former Scotland Yard detective and currently forensic researcher , along with a team of researchers , came to the conclusion that most of the evidence leads to Deeming as Jack the Ripper . </s> <s> This aired on a Discovery Channel documentary in 2011 . </s> <s> According to Napper the display of Deeming 's death mask as that of `` Jack the Ripper '' in the Scotland Yard Museum of Crime shows that the police had , in fact , always considered him a prime suspect . </s> <s> The reason that the police officially dismissed Deeming as a suspect of the Whitechapel murders , according to Napper , is that they had believed he was either in jail at the time according to some or that he was in South Africa according to others . </s> <s> But Napper proved that he was not in jail at the time , and pointed to evidence that he had in fact been back from South Africa to England at the time of the murders . </s> <s> He also pointed to a motive ( incurring syphilis from a prostitute ) , a criminal profile and killing pattern that fitted exactly . </s> <s> Deeming 's death mask is on display at the Old Melbourne Gaol in Melbourne , where he was executed , and at the Black Museum at New Scotland Yard . </s> <s> Roberto Succo ( April 3 , 1962 in Mestre – May 23 , 1988 in Vicenza ) was an

<s> On December 16 , 2008 , 27 years after the 1981 murder Hollywood , Florida , police announced Toole as the murderer , and the Adam Walsh case was closed . </s> <s> The police did not reveal any new physical evidence and pointed out that they still had no DNA evidence . </s> <s> In 1984 , Toole confessed to two unsolved northwest Florida slayings , including one of the I-10 murders . </s> <s> During an interview , he admitted to killing 18-year-old David Schallart , a hitchhiker he picked up east of Pensacola . </s> <s> Schallart 's body , bearing five gunshot wounds in the left side of the head , was found on February 6 , 1980 , approximately 125 feet ( 38 m ) off I-10 's eastbound lane , 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) east of Chipley . </s> <s> The second confession involved the death of 20-year-old Ada Johnson . </s> <s> Toole confessed that he shot her in the head on a road outside of Fort Walton Beach after kidnapping her at gunpoint at a Tallahassee nightclub . </s> <s> Psychiatrists Dr. Urbina and Dr. Sanches testified at Toole 's 1984 Florida Supreme Court appeal that he was extremely impulsive and exhibited antisocial behavior as a result of a personality disorder and that he was a pyromaniac . </s> <s> The court found sufficient evidence that Toole was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder . </s> <s> Toole claimed to have picked Walsh up in a Sears mall parking lot . </s> <s> Toole said he offered him candy and toys and that Walsh came willingly . </s> <s> Walsh soon wanted to go home and began crying . </s> <s> Toole said he then punched him in the face . </s> <s> Walsh started crying more , and according to Toole , he began to `` wallop '' Walsh , knocking him out . </s> <s> Toole eventually pulled over in a rural area and decapitated Walsh with a machete . </s> <s> He drove around for several days with Walsh 's head , forgot about it , and , upon rediscovering it , tossed it into a nearby canal . </s> <s> Police inexplicably lost Toole 's impounded car and its bloodstained carpeting , hindering their ability to proceed with the investigation . </s> <s> Hollywood , Florida Police Chief Chadwick Wagner said Ottis Toole had been the prime suspect all along , but went on to admit that although Toole 's case was weak , he could have been charged during the original investigation . </s> <s> Wagner acknowledged that many mistakes were made by the department and apologized to the Walsh family . </s> <s> Public critics of the indictment [ who ? ] </s> <s> argue that lack of new ( public ) evidence , and the inability of the defendant to defend himself of the allegations , leaves no definitive claim to his guilt . </s> <s> To this Wagner has stated : `` If you 're looking for that magic wand , that one piece of evidence , it 's not there . </s> <s> `` However , by reexamining previously uncorrelated evidence , police and the Walsh family were satisfied with the new report and existing evidence that points only to Ottis Toole . </s> <s> In response to the naming of his son 's alleged murderer , John Walsh stated : `` We can now move forward knowing positively who killed our beautiful little boy . </s> <s> `` </s> <s> The decision was finally reached once Toole 's niece told John Walsh that her uncle confessed on his deathbed in prison that he had murdered and decapitated Adam . </s> <s> The book Frustrated Witness , written by former Miami Herald writer Willis Morgan , examines the Walsh case and cites circumstantial evidence that suggests that another serial killer , Jeffrey Dahmer , may have killed Walsh . </s> <s> At the time of Walsh 's murder , Dahmer was living a short drive away in Miami Beach and working at a sub shop where he had access to a blue van similar to the one seen leaving the mall after Walsh 's disappearance . </s> <s> A number of witnesses reported seeing a man looking like Dahmer at the mall talking to young boys . </s> <s> When interviewed about Adam in the early 1990s , Dahmer repeatedly denied involvement in the crime , even stating ; `` I 've told you everything—how I killed them , how I cooked them , who I ate . </s> <s> Why would n't I tell you if I did someone else ? </s> <s> `` After this rumor surfaced , John Walsh stated that he had `` seen no evidence '' linking his son 's kidnapping and murder to Dahmer . </s> <s> Toole died at Florida State Prison of cirrhosis on September 15 , 1996 , at the age of 49 . </s> <s> His body went unclaimed and he was buried in the Florida State Prison Cemetery . </s> <s> A character based on Toole was portrayed by Tom Towles in Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer . </s> <s> Toole and the murder of Adam Walsh are mentioned in Execution , the fifteenth episode of the third season of Law & Order : Special Victims Unit

Riffian ) alias the Monster of Merano , was a serial killer in South Tyrol , Italy . </s> <s> He killed six people in Merano during 1996 , before he died . </s> <s> Born into a family devoted to pastoralism , Gamper 's childhood and adolescence was characterized by poverty and work in the fields . </s> <s> Many described him as a shy person , with a tendency to isolate himself , while others portrayed him as a mentally ill man . </s> <s> As a child he was sexually abused by his father , and perhaps for this reason he was unable to have a normal approach towards women . </s> <s> Gamper spent many years working as a pastor in Switzerland , then returned home , finding employment in a hayloft in Riffian . </s> <s> With a criminal record for contempt , resistance of a public official and public intoxication , he began to develop anti-Italian feelings from an early age , so much so that he joined Ein Tyrol , a secessionist terrorist group , which claimed the annexation of South Tyrol to Austria . </s> <s> Moreover , Gamper did not even know the Italian language . </s> <s> Two events marked the collapse of his already-disturbed psyche : the 1989 suicide of younger brother Richard , then the death of his father . </s> <s> The first of the murders he committed took place on February 8 , 1996 , in Merano , where , with a gunshot to the back of the head , he killed 61-year-old Hans-Otto Detmering , an official for the Deutsche Bundesbank , and his Italian mistress , 50-year-old Clorinda Cecchetti : both were killed while walking along the Passer stream . </s> <s> At first it was thought to be of an economic-patrimonial motive , linked to a private matter of the German banker . </s> <s> It was also suggested to be a crime of passion , for which Detmering 's wife was a suspect , but the investigative hypothesis remained unanswered . </s> <s> On February 14 , in the Merano area of Sinigo , a 58-year-old farmer , Umberto Marchioro , was shot in the head near his home . </s> <s> The weapon turned out to be the same one used in the murder of the two lovers ; the method of execution was identical . </s> <s> In the face of such evidence , the investigative authority began to formulate the hypothesis that a serial killer could be the culprit . </s> <s> A few days later , a young drug-addicted blogger , Luca Nobile , was arrested on charges of being the perpetrator of the murders . </s> <s> On February 27 , in the center of Merano , 36-year-old accountant Paolo Vecchiolini was killed while walking with his girlfriend . </s> <s> The method and weapon used for the murder were the same as the previous ones . </s> <s> Despite the shocking attack , the girlfriend managed to provide the investigators with a facial composite , which described a tall , blond man in overalls , carrying a rucksack . </s> <s> This new murder led the investigators to resume the murder trail , which exonerated Luca Nobile from any involvement . </s> <s> On the morning of March 1 , another murder took place in Riffian . </s> <s> The victim was a neighbour of the South Tyrolean killer , 58-year-old bricklayer Tullio Melchiorri , who was shot in the forehead . </s> <s> After a series of testimonies and reports , the investigators managed to identify a potential suspect who lived in the area . </s> <s> Near the body of Melchiorri were found two sheets containing sentences in German with racist and delusional content : `` Italian pig , you settled in South Tyrol '' and `` I am an Italian emigrant , or nazi , I am only responsible for infanticide . </s> <s> You have arrived late . '' </s> <s> ( the latter was found by carabiniers near the crime scene ) . </s> <s> Gamper had fled and taken refuge in his farm . </s> <s> Marshal Guerrino Botte tried to approach the hiding Gamper , but was hit with a bullet to the face . </s> <s> After an intervention by Criminalpol and the state police , a firefight broke out . </s> <s> The seriously wounded sergeant was transported to a hospital in Bolzano , where he died shortly after . </s> <s> During the siege , a shot was heard from inside the farm . </s> <s> At this point , the authorities broke in and found the lifeless body of Ferdinand Gamper , who had committed suicide with a gunshot to the head . </s> <s> The agents had no doubts that he was the Monster of Merano , who had terrified the population of the South Tyrolean city , especially those who spoke the Italian language . </s> <s> The weapon used by Gamper was a Weihrauch .22 caliber Magnum rifle with a sawed-off barrel and butt to make it concealable in a backpack which he carried with him , which later turned out to be the same weapon used in all six of the murders . </s> <s> After Gamper 's suicide , the investigators continued to deepen their knowledge of the killer 's personality . </s> <s> In the beginning it was believed that the murders were committed solely because of schizophrenia , but this pathology had not been diagnosed by a doctor , so much that the name Gamper was not included in any list of mentally ill patients in the Bolzano province . </s> <s> Ethnic and racial hatred was then taken into consideration . </s> <s> Gamper , as noticed by the few people that knew him well , openly hated the Italians and seemed to be a pure misogynist . </s> <s> The victims of his murders were mainly males of Italian nationality , except for Detmering , who was a German citizen , but the killer was probably deceived by the fact that the banker was speaking in Italian to his lover . </s> <s> The story of the `` Monster of Merano '' received particular attention from the mass media , especially the German ones . </s> <s> The German press , in particular , had always insisted on ethnic hatred as a motive for the murders carried out by Gamper . </s> <s> The story of Ferdinand Gamper highlighted the difficult situation which made the coexistence in South Tyrol between the German and the Italian linguistic groups a problem for many decades . </s> <s> Max Gufler ( May 1 , 1918 – 1966 in Krems an der Donau ) was an Austrian serial killer . </s> <s> What is known about Gufler 's childhood is that he was repeatedly haunted by unpredictable violence as a result of a serious skull injury , which he had suffered at the age of nine years from an incident . </s> <s> During the Second World War , he was again injured as an ambulance driver of the Wehrmacht in frontline operations from shrapnel in his head area . </s> <s> His impaired physical and mental condition could be an explanation for his actions . </s> <s> After the Second World War , Gufler worked in the Lower Austrian town of St. Pölten as a bookseller until he met in 1951 the daughter of a tobacconist . </s> <s> In his father-in-law 's kiosk , he offered customers banned pornographic photos , eventually leading to his and the kiosk owner 's detention . </s> <s> Barely released from custody , Gufler killed prostitute Emilie Meystrzik , who was found in 1952 with a broken skull in a love hotel in the Viennese red-light district . </s> <s> Gufler , who now worked as a vacuum cleaner representative , developed into a cunning marriage swindler who promised marriage to women and killed them as soon as he had managed to get their money . </s> <s> He invited his victims to a honeymoon and then anaesthetisized them with coffee spiked with barbituric acid . </s> <s> He drowned the unconscious victims in lakes to make the crime look like a suicide . </s> <s> After the murder of Maria Robas in September 1958 , the evidence against Gufler thickened . </s> <s> He was arrested in St. Pölten because of an urgent suspicion of having murdered 18 women since the end of the war . </s> <s> In order to be able to convict him , a new procedure was developed by Viennese forensics doctors at the time , with which two sleep aids could be separated and individually identified . </s> <s> Although he was charged with seven murders , only four murders and two attempted murders were proven in a jury trial before the Vienna District Court for Criminal Matters . </s> <s> Despite his severe brain trauma , Gufler was sentenced to life imprisonment in May 1961 . </s> <s> In 1966 he died at Stein Prison in Krems an der Donau . </s> <s> Stanisław Modzelewski ( born 15 March 1929 in Szczepankowo near Łomża , died on 13 November 1969 in Warsaw ) was a Polish serial killer known as `` The Vampire of Gałkówek '' active in Łódź , Poland during the 1950s . </s> <s> He completed three classes of primary school , he was a driver by occupation and he worked in Warsaw . </s> <s> In the period of 1952-1956 and in 1967 , he murdered seven women and attempted a murder of six other women . </s> <s> Although he is believed to have murdered another , eighth victim ( he even confessed to it ) , it was never proven , as the body was never found . </s> <s> He was sentenced to death and the execution by hanging , which was carried out in November 1969 , in Warsaw . </s> <s> Modzelewski murdered women in the age between 18 and 87 by strangling them with a scarf or with his bare hands . </s> <s> He took valuables as well as useless objects from his victims which he then threw away . </s> <s> He executed them with utmost cruelty . </s> <s> The murders had a sexual motive , the lower part of the victims ' bodies were nude and the arrangement of the corpse suggested a penetration of genital organs . </s> <s> Modzelewski was a sadist but it was not verified whether he tortured the victims before or after the murder . </s> <s> The list contains names of the confirmed victims of Modzelewski , place of murder , cause of death , and the approximate date of murder </s> <s> The investigation of the Vampire of Gałkówek 's murders was discontinued in 1957 . </s> <s> Despite the thoroughness of the investigation , the perpetrator was not found as the police were led astray from the beginning . </s> <s> They assumed that the murderer was a Polish State Railways employee as the crimes were committed near the railway track and some of the women who managed to survive stated that the offender was wearing a uniform . </s> <s> As a result , the perpetrator was not found and the local people continued to live in fear . </s> <s> 10 years later the case was reopened because of the murder in Warsaw . </s> <s> The suspect of killing Maria Gałecka was soon found . </s> <s> It was Stanisław Modzelewski , her ex-neighbour and he was known to have had a number of disputes with the victim . </s> <s> The Freeway Phantom is a media epithet for an unidentified serial killer who was active in Washington , D.C. from April 1971 through September 1972 . </s> <s> On the evening of April 25 , 1971 , 13-year-old Spinks from Southeast was sent by an older sister to buy groceries at a 7-Eleven located a half-mile away from her home , just across the border in Maryland . </s> <s> On her way home from the store , Spinks was abducted ; her body was found six days later at 2:46 pm behind St. Elizabeths Hospital on a grassy embankment next to the northbound lanes of I-295 , about 1,500 feet south of Suitland Parkway . </s> <s> Examination revealed she had been both physically and sexually assaulted and strangled , was dressed but missing her shoes , and had only been killed a few days previously . </s> <s> On July 8 , 1971 , Johnson , 16 , from Congress Heights was abducted while en route to her summer job at Oxon Hill Recreation Center . </s> <s> One witness reported having seen Johnson in an old black car , driven by an African-American male , shortly after her abduction . </s> <s> Eleven days later , her body was located only 15 feet ( 5.5 meters ) from where Spinks had been found even though police had been notified of the location of the corpse nearly a week earlier by an anonymous caller who had details only her killer could have known . </s> <s> By that time , Johnson 's body ( again dressed but without her shoes ) was far too decomposed to determine the cause of death or if she had been sexually assaulted , but law enforcement was able to find evidence of strangulation . </s> <s> On July 27 , 1971 , 10-year-old Crockett from Northwest failed to return home after having been sent to the store by her mother . </s> <s> About two hours later ( around 9:20 pm ) the Crocketts ' phone rang and was answered by her 7-year-old sister , who had waited at home while her family searched the neighborhood . </s> <s> Crockett was on the other line , crying . </s> <s> `` A white man picked me up , and I 'm heading home in a cab , '' Crockett told her sister , adding that she believed she was in Virginia before abruptly saying , '' Bye '' and hanging up . </s> <s> A short time later , the phone rang again and was this time answered by the boyfriend of Crockett 's mother . </s> <s> It was Crockett again , and she merely repeated what she 'd said in the last telephone call , adding `` Did my mother see me ? '' </s> <s> and indicating she was alone in a house with a white male . </s> <s> The boyfriend asked her to have the man come to the phone . </s> <s> Heavy footsteps were heard in the background and Crockett said `` I 'll see you '' and hung up . </s> <s> Authorities quickly concluded that Crockett likely called her home at the behest of the killer , who fed her inaccurate information in order to buy the necessary time to perpetrate the crime , and to hamper the investigation . </s> <s> At 5:50 am the next day , a hitchhiker discovered Crockett 's shoeless body in a conspicuous location on U.S. Route 50 , near the Baltimore-Washington Parkway in Prince George 's County , Maryland . </s> <s> She had been raped and strangled , and a scarf was knotted around her neck . </s> <s> 12-year-old Yates was walking home around 7:00 pm from a Safeway store in Northeast on October 1 , 1971 when she was kidnapped , raped , and strangled . </s> <s> Her body was found within three hours of her abduction , just off the shoulder of Pennsylvania Avenue in Prince George 's County , Maryland . </s> <s> As with the other cases , her shoes were missing and unidentified green fibers would also be found on her clothing . </s> <s> A witness apparently saw her getting into a blue Volkswagen , and although investigated , the lead led nowhere . </s> <s> It was after this murder that the `` Freeway Phantom '' moniker was first used in a Daily News article describing the murders . </s> <s> After having dinner with a high school classmate on November 15 , 1971 , Woodward , 18 , from Baltimore boarded a city bus around 11:30 pm to return to her Maryland Avenue home . </s> <s> Approximately six hours later , a police officer discovered her body , which had been stabbed multiple times and strangled , in a grassy area near Prince George 's County Hospital , along an access ramp to Route 202 from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway . </s> <s> Unlike the other victims , she was still wearing her shoes , and a coat had been placed over her chest . </s> <s> One of its pockets contained a note from the killer : </s> <s> this is tAntAmount to my </s> <s> insensititivity [ sic ] to people </s> <s> especiAlly women . </s> <s> I will Admit the others </s> <s> wheN you cAtch me iF you cAn ! </s> <s> FRee-wAy PhanTom </s> <s> Based on handwriting samples , authorities surmised that the note , written on paper cut from the victim 's school notebook , had been dictated to and handwritten by Woodward . </s> <s> They also speculated that , given the absence of indications of duress in the writing , apart from evidence of dysgraphia , she may have known her kidnapper . </s> <s> The Phantom 's final victim was claimed almost a year later , on September 5 , 1972 . </s> <s> A 17-year-old Ballou High School senior , Williams cooked dinner for her family and then visited her boyfriend 's house . </s> <s> She was last seen boarding a bus at 11:20 pm near his house . </s> <s> A few hours later , her strangled body was discovered dumped alongside I-295 , just south of the District line . </s> <s> As with other victims , her shoes were missing , but no signs of sexual assault were found although traces of semen ( assumed to be from the boyfriend ) were found . </s> <s> The Freeway Phantom case has seen a myriad of investigators and garnered much interest over the years . </s> <s> Numerous investigative tips came from the general public by a telephone hotline operated by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia ( MPDC ) and information also came by way of the mail . </s> <s> All these leads were investigated to their logical conclusion . </s> <s> Some leads were easily proven not to be viable , while others required substantial investigation . </s> <s> The investigation was conducted by a law enforcement task force that included Detectives from the MPDC Homicide and Sex Squads , investigators from Prince George 's County and Montgomery County , Maryland , Maryland State Police , and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) . </s> <s> Common practice at the time was that case files at MPDC Detective Divisions were retained by the detectives assigned to the case . </s> <s> As a result , the Freeway Phantom case files are now incomplete - some have been discarded entirely and others are incomplete with pages or articles of evidence having been lost , along with their associated notes , and all the primary or task force investigators have either long retired , or are deceased . </s> <s> With current evidence and any information of the case from when it happened , no leads produced sufficient evidence for prosecution . </s> <s> This case , which has been closed and opened a number of times over its history , is currently open as a cold case in the MPDC Homicide Division . </s> <s> A reward of $ 150,000 remains open as well . </s> <s> Among those individuals considered suspects were members of a gang known as the Green Vega Rapists . </s> <s> Members of this gang were collectively responsible for numerous Washington D.C. and surrounding Maryland vicinity rapes and abductions that occurred near the Washington Beltway . </s> <s> Logical investigation and intimate knowledge of the modus operandi of the Green Vega Gang brought them to the forefront . </s> <s> The Green Vega Gang members were individually interviewed by MPDC Homicide Detectives Fickling , Irving , and Richardson , at Lorton Prison in Virginia , where the gang members were serving sentences in conjunction with the successful prosecutions of those crimes in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia . </s> <s> During these interviews , one gang member initially implicated another gang member , who he said told him he was involved and gave information as to one of the beltway homicides . </s> <s> This particular inmate was also serving a sentence at Lorton Prison for the Green Vega convictions . </s>

information , the date and location of the crime , and signature detail which was not provided to the public , but which was known only to the perpetrator , and to detectives . </s> <s> That signature information was correct . </s> <s> The inmate who provided the information said he was not involved in the homicide , and provided an alibi which was found to be verifiable . </s> <s> During this period , an election was being held in Maryland , and one of the candidates publicly announced to the press that a break had occurred in the Freeway Phantom investigation , and provided that an inmate at Lorton Prison had given the information . </s> <s> After that announcement , the inmate who provided the information declined any further interviews , and denied that he had ever provided any information . </s> <s> [ citation needed ] </s> <s> Sullivan and Simmons , two ex-cops , were arrested for the murder of Angela Denise Barnes . </s> <s> Barnes , 14 , was at one point thought to be a

near Cherepanovs ' Passage , with Belov hitting the victim with a baseball bat , but she furiously resisted and forced him to flee . </s> <s> But just a few hours later , on Lyapidevsky Street , Belov and Shabanov killed their final victim . </s> <s> Belov and Shabanov were not afraid of being caught : they drove to the crime scene by car , without fearing that someone could remember their number .

`` After the first corpse , it 's hard to sleep , then you get used to it .

arrested . </s> <s> There is also a third version of Ionesyan 's biography , set forth in the `` Komsomolskaya Pravda '' , which brought excerpts from the records of his interrogation . </s> <s>

recognition . </s> <s> This is confirmed by the fact that in the Orenburg Musical Comedy Theater Ionesyan , despite his vocal education , played second-class roles , but believed he deserved more . </s> <s> This was the main reason that in 1963 he moved to Moscow - to proven that he deserved better . </s> <s> There is also an opinion that Ionesyan was not a spree killer , for which the killing

, bought from GUM . </s> <s> Oustretched outer detail was the ushanka , which Ionesyan , unlike the overwhelming number of Muscovites , tied at the back of the head , and not on the top , which immediately gave investigators a tip to the fact that the killer is non-resident . </s> <s> Nevertheless , there are cases when Ionesyan put on a kepi instead of an ushanka . </s> <s> Ionesyan committed the first murder on December 20 , 1963 in apartment No . </s> <s> 95 on the fourth floor on Baltiskaya Street in the Sokol District . </s> <s> Under the guise of a Mosgaz employee , he walked through several apartments at a time , where he inspected for a convenient victim under the pretext of a preventative inspection of gas equipment . </s> <s> That convenient victim was 12-year-old Konstantin Sobolev . </s> <s> After making sure that there was no one at home , Ionesyan inflicted a large number of blows with the axe on the boy ( according to other sources , the killer used a knife , and this was the only time he supposedly used a knife ) . </s> <s> After killing the child , Ionesyan took his sweater , 60 rubles , a bottle of cologne `` Shipr '' and beach glasses . </s> <s> After questioning the tenants of the house , the police went to 9-year-old Vladimir Teplov ( to protect the witness in all documents , including at court , his name was listed as Artem Frolov ) . </s> <s> The three-room communal apartment No . </s> <s> 86 , located on the second floor , was the first one Ionesyan entered when he was in the house ( there were no residential premises on the

for him , was only his 70-year-old grandmother and a baby . </s> <s> Probably , because of this , Ionesyan did not attack the boy , but , in hesitation , went into the kitchen and inspected the gas stove , from the handle of which policemen removed the clear fingerprints of his fingers . </s> <s> Teplov 's testimony ( in particular , that the stranger was slightly hunchbacked , although his Caucasian appearance was not pronounced ) played a big role in the work of criminalist Sophia Feinstein , who made a facial composite . </s> <s> To recreate the criminal 's appearance , they also sought help from the artist Naum Karpovsky and famous sculptor and anthropologist Mikhail Gerasimov . </s> <s> At some point , while Feinstein was working with Teplov , one of MUR 's officers glanced into her office , who coincidentally turned out to be very similar to Ionesyan , which allowed to make a more accurate portrait of the murderer . </s> <s> It was Teplov who first said about the hat of the stranger and how it was tied on the back of the head , which was then not typical for Muscovites and betrayed him as an outsider . </s> <s> Subsequently , Teplov identified the criminal during the investigative experiment and gave a testimony at a closed trial in the Supreme Court of the RSFSR . </s> <s> On December 25 , 1963 , Ionesyan , together with Dmitrieva , came to Ivanovo , where he committed two murders . </s> <s> Continuing to pretend to be a gas worker , he entered apartments and looked for suitable victims . </s> <s> In an apartment on Kalinin Street he killed a 12-year-old boy named Mikhail Kuleshov with an axe , then stole his jacket , a pullover , two pens and several bonds . </s> <s> In another apartment , on Oktyabrskaya Street , he killed a 74-year-old woman , but only took a pocket flashlight and 70 kopeks from her apartment . </s> <s> Returning to Kalinin Street , he again began to walk around the apartments . </s> <s> In one of them he attacked 15-year-old Galina Petropavlovskaya , who was raped and then struck nine times to the head with the axe . </s> <s> Ionesyan then took a sweater , a jacket , a fluffy shawl and 90 rubles . </s> <s> Despite her injuries , Petropavlovskaya survived and was able to describe her attacker 's appearance . </s> <s> In the evening Ionesyan told Dmitrieva that because of the `` government task '' he carried out , both of them could be killed , and said it was urgent to leave Ivanovo . </s> <s> They left on foot , walked 10 kilometers towards Moscow and only then took a bus . </s> <s> After the murders in Ivanovo , the case of the `` Mosgaz Murderer '' was given special status , and was taken under the personal control by the Minister of Public Order Protection ( as it was then called the Ministry of Internal Affairs ) Vadim Tikunov and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Alexei Kosygin . </s> <s> Nikita Khrushchev was also interested in the matter . </s> <s> On December 28 in Moscow , in an apartment on Leningradsky Avenue , Ionesyan killed 11-year-old Alexander Lisovets . </s> <s> When he struck him first with the axe , the boy ran to the toilet and tried to lock it behind him , but the perpetrator managed to overtake him and killed Alexander in the toilet . </s> <s> Ionesyan did not take anything from the apartment : the door to the room where the cabinet stood was locked , and he could not find the key and crack it . </s> <s> Ionesyan committed his last murder on January 8 , 1964 in an apartment on Sheremetyevskaya Street , near the Marina Grove . </s> <s> The victim was 46-year-old Maria Ermakova , to whom he introduced himself as an employee of the housing office . </s> <s> Ionesyan struck her about twenty times with his axe , then took from her apartment five skeins of yarn , three pairs of socks , a purse , 30 rubles , a Mir clock and a Start-3 television set . </s> <s> Several residents of the Marina Grove told the police that they saw how on the day of the murder a young man of southern appearance with a turned off TV in a sheet had left the street in a truck . </s> <s> The district commissioner Malyshev had also seen it , and managed to remember the first digits of the truck 's license plate - 96 . </s> <s> The detectives quickly learned the full number - MOG 96-26 . </s> <s> The driver admitted that he really had driven a man of Caucasian

the population of Hanover regarding the fate of the sheer number of children and teenagers who had been reported missing in the city ; the discoveries sparked fresh rumors regarding missing and murdered children . </s> <s> In addition , various newspapers responded to these discoveries and the resulting rumors by harking to the disproportionate number of young people who had been reported missing in Hanover between 1918 and 1924 . </s> <s> ( In 1923 alone , almost 600 teenage boys and young men had been reported missing in Hanover . </s> <s> ) </s> <s> On 8 June , several hundred Hanover residents converged close to the Leine River and searched both the banks of the river and the surrounding areas , discovering a number of human bones , which were handed to the police . </s>

further human bones and sections of bodies—many bearing knife striations—which were later confirmed by a court doctor as having belonged to at least 22 separate human individuals . </s> <s> Approximately half of the remains had been in the river for some time , whereas other bones and body parts had been discarded in the river more recently . </s> <s> Many of the recent and aged discoveries bore evidence of having been dissected—particularly at the joints . </s> <s> Over 30 percent of the remains were judged to have belonged to young males aged between 15 and 20 . </s> <s> Suspicion for the discoveries quickly fell upon Haarmann , who was known to both the police and the criminal investigation department as a homosexual who had amassed 15 previous convictions dating from 1896 for various offenses including child molestation and the sexual assault and battery of a minor . </s> <s> Moreover , Haarmann had been connected to the 1918 disappearances of Friedel Rothe and a 14-year-old named Hermann Koch ( who had disappeared weeks prior to Rothe ) . </s> <s> Haarmann was placed under surveillance . </s> <s> Being a trusted police informant , Haarmann was known to frequent Hanover Central Station . </s> <s> As he was well-known to many officers from Hanover , two young policemen were drafted from Berlin to pose as undercover officers and discreetly observe his movements . </s> <s> The surveillance of Haarmann began on 18 June 1924 . </s> <s> On the night of 22 June , Haarmann was observed by the two undercover officers prowling Hanover 's central station . </s> <s> He was soon observed arguing with a 15-year-old boy named Karl Fromm , then to approach police and insist they arrest the youth on the charge of travelling upon forged documents . </s> <s> Upon his arrest , Fromm informed police he had been living with Haarmann for four days , and that he had been repeatedly raped by his accuser , sometimes as a knife was held to his throat . </s> <s> Haarmann was arrested the following morning and charged with sexual assault . </s> <s> Following his arrest . </s> <s> Haarmann 's attic apartment at No . </s> <s> 2 Rote Reihe was searched . </s> <s> Haarmann had lived in this single room apartment since June 1923 . </s> <s> The flooring , walls and bedding within the apartment were found to be extensively bloodstained . </s> <s> Haarmann initially attempted to explain this fact as a by-product of his illegal trading in contraband meat . </s> <s> Various acquaintances and former neighbors of Haarmann were also extensively questioned as to his activities . </s> <s> Many fellow tenants and neighbors of the various addresses in which Haarmann lived since 1920 commented to detectives about the number of teenage boys they observed visiting his various addresses . </s> <s> Moreover , some had seen him leaving his property with concealed sacks , bags or baskets—invariably in the late evening or early morning hours . </s> <s> Two former tenants informed police that , in the spring of 1924 , they had discreetly followed Haarmann from his apartment and observed him discarding a sack into the Leine River . </s> <s> The clothes and personal possessions found at Haarmann 's apartment and in the possession of his acquaintances were suspected as being the property of missing youths : all were confiscated and put on display at Hanover Police Station , with the parents of missing teenage boys from across Germany invited to look at the items . </s> <s> As successive days passed , an increasing number of items were identified by family members as having belonged to their sons and brothers . </s> <s> Haarmann did initially attempt to dismiss these successive revelations as being circumstantial in nature by explaining he acquired many of these items through his business of trading in used clothing , with other items being left at his apartment by youths with whom he engaged in sexual activity . </s> <s> The turning point came when , on 29 June , clothes , boots and keys found stowed at Haarmann 's apartment were identified as belonging to a missing 18-year-old named Robert Witzel . </s> <s> A skull which had been found in a garden on 20 May ( which was not initially connected with later skeletal discoveries ) was identified as that of the missing youth . </s> <s> A friend of Witzel identified a police officer seen in the company of the youth the day prior to his disappearance as Haarmann . </s> <s> Confronted with this evidence , Haarmann briefly attempted to bluster his way out of these latest and most damning pieces of evidence . </s> <s> When Witzel 's jacket was found in the possession of his landlady and he was confronted with various witnesses ' testimony as to his destroying identification marks upon the clothing , he broke down and had to be supported by his sister . </s> <s> [ n 5 ] </s> <s> Faced with this latest evidence , and upon the urging of his sister , Haarmann confessed to raping , killing and dismembering many young men in what he initially described as a `` rabid sexual passion '' between 1918 and 1924 . </s> <s> According to Haarmann , he never actually intended to murder any of his victims , but would be seized by an irresistible urge to bite into or through their Adam 's apple—often as he manually strangled them—in the throes of ecstasy , before typically collapsing atop the victim 's body . </s> <s> Only one intended victim had escaped from Haarmann 's apartment after he attempted to bite into his Adam 's apple , although this individual is not known to have reported the attack to police . </s> <s> All of Haarmann 's victims ' bodies were disposed of via dismemberment shortly after their murder , and Haarmann was insistent that he found the act of dismemberment extremely unpleasant ; he had , he stated , been ill for eight days after his first murder . </s> <s> Nonetheless , Haarmann was insistent that his passion at the moment of murder was invariably `` stronger than the horror of the cutting and the chopping '' which would inevitably follow , and would typically take up to two days to complete . </s> <s> To fortify himself to dismember his victims ' bodies , Haarmann would pour himself a cup of strong black coffee , then place the body of his victim upon the floor of this apartment and cover the face with cloth , before first removing the intestines , which he would place inside a bucket . </s> <s> A towel would then be repeatedly placed inside the abdominal cavity to soak the collecting blood . </s> <s> He would then make three cuts between the victim 's ribs and shoulders , then `` take hold of the ribs and push until the bones around the shoulders broke . </s> <s> `` The victim 's heart , lungs and kidneys would then be removed , diced , and placed in the same bucket which held the intestines before the legs and arms would be severed from the body . </s> <s> Haarmann would then begin paring the flesh from the limbs and torso . </s> <s> This surplus flesh would be disposed of in the toilet or , usually , in the nearby river . </s> <s> The final section of the victims ' bodies to be dismembered was invariably the head . </s> <s> After severing the head from the torso , Haarmann would use a small kitchen knife to strip all flesh from the skull , which he would then wrap in rags and place face downwards upon a pile of straw and bludgeon with an axe until the skull splintered , enabling him to access the brain . </s> <s> This he would also place in a bucket , which he would pour , alongside the `` chopped up bones '' in the Leine . </s> <s> Haarmann was insistent that none of the skulls found in the Leine belonged to his victims , and that the forensic identification of the skull of Robert Witzel was mistaken , as he had almost invariably smashed his victims ' skulls to pieces . </s> <s> The exceptions being those of his earliest victims—killed several years prior to his arrest—and that of his last victim , Erich de Vries . </s> <s> Although insistent that none of his murders were premeditated , investigators discovered much circumstantial evidence suggesting that several murders had been planned hours or days in advance , and that Haarmann had both concocted explanations for his victims ' disappearances and dissuaded acquaintances of his victims from filing missing persons ' reports with Hanover police . </s> <s> Investigators also noted that Haarmann would only confess to murders for which there existed evidence against him ; on one occasion , Haarmann stated : `` There are some [ victims ] you do n't know about , but it 's not those you think . '' </s> <s> When asked how many victims he killed , Haarmann claimed , `` Somewhere between 50 and 70 . '' </s> <s> The police , however , could only connect Haarmann with the disappearance of 27 youths , and he was charged with 27 murders—some of which he claimed were committed upon the insistence of Hans Grans , who was arrested on 8 July , and formally charged with being an accessory to murder one week later . </s> <s> [ n 6 ] </s> <s> On 16 August 1924 , Haarmann underwent a psychological examination at a Göttingen medical school ; on 25 September , he was judged competent to stand trial and returned to Hanover to await trial . </s> <s> The trial of Fritz Haarmann and Hans Grans began on 4 December 1924 . </s> <s> Haarmann was charged with the murder of 27 boys and young men who had disappeared between September 1918 and June that year . </s> <s> In 14 of these cases , Haarmann—who insisted upon conducting his own defense—acknowledged his guilt , although he claimed to be uncertain of the identification of the remaining 13 victims upon the list of charges . </s> <s> Grans pleaded not guilty to charges of being an accessory to murder in several of the murders . </s> <s> Initially , following a thorough security search , all members of the public were permitted access to the courtroom , although by the third day the judge excluded all spectators from the courtroom in the opening days of the trial as each murder was discussed in detail , due to the ongoing carnal and gruesome nature of the revelations . </s> <s> The trial was one of the first major modern media events in Germany , and received extensive international press coverage , being described as the `` most revolting [ case ] in German criminal history . </s> <s> `` Varying sensational headlines—in which Haarmann was variously referred to by such titles as the `` Butcher of Hanover , '' the `` Vampire of Hanover , '' and the `` Wolf Man '' —continuously appeared in the press . </s> <s> Although Haarmann denied any premeditation in the crimes , and remained adamant the ultimate reason he killed was a `` mystery '' to him , he readily confessed to having killed 14 of the victims for whose murder he was tried and to retaining and selling many of their possessions , although he denied having sold the body parts of any of his victims as contraband meat . </s> <s> Haarmann 's denial that he had either consumed or sold human flesh would be supported by a medical expert , who testified on 6 December that none of the meat found in Haarmann 's apartment following his arrest was human . </s> <s> When asked to identify photographs of his victims , Haarmann became taciturn and dismissive as he typically claimed to be unable to recognize any of his victims ' photographs ; however , in instances where he claimed to be unable to recognize his victims ' faces but the victims ' clothing or other personal belongings had been found in his possession , he would simply shrug and make comments to the effect of , `` I probably killed him , '' or : `` Charge it to me ; it 's alright with me . </s> <s> `` For example , when asked to identify a photograph of victim Alfred Hogrefe , Haarmann stated : `` I certainly assume I killed Hogrefe , but I do n't remember his face . </s> <s> `` [ n 7 ] </s> <s> Numerous exhibits were introduced into evidence in the opening days of the trial , including 285 sections of the skeletal structure—particularly skulls and thigh bones—recovered from the Leine River and forensically determined as belonging to young men under 20 years of age which had been retrieved from the Leine River , the bucket into which he stored and transported human remains , and the extensively bloodstained camp bed upon which he had killed many of the victims at his Rote Reihe address . </s> <s> As had been the case when earlier asked whether he could recognize the photographs of any of his victims , Haarmann 's demeanour became dismissive upon the introduction of these exhibits ; he denied any of the skulls introduced into evidence belonged to his victims , stating he had almost invariably `` mashed '' the victims ' skulls , and had thrown only one undamaged skull into the river . </s> <s> Several acquaintances and criminal associates of Haarmann testified for the prosecution , including former neighbors who testified to having purchased brawn or mince from Haarmann , whom they noted regularly left his apartment with packages of meat , but rarely arrived with them . </s> <s> Haarmann 's landlady , Elisabeth Engel , testified that Haarmann would regularly pour chopped pieces of meat into boiling water and would strain fat from meat Haarmann claimed was pork . </s> <s> This fat would invariably be poured into bottles . </s> <s> On one occasion in April 1924 , Haarmann 's landlady and her family became ill after eating sausages in skins Haarmann claimed were sheep 's intestines . </s> <s> Another neighbor testified to the alarming number of youths whom he had seen entering Haarmann 's Neue Straße apartment , but whom he seldom observed leaving the address . </s> <s> This neighbor assumed Haarmann was selling youths to the Foreign Legion ; another neighbor testified to having observed Haarmann throw a sack of bones into the Leine River . </s> <s> Two female acquaintances of Hans Grans also testified how , on one occasion in 1923 , they discovered what they believed to be a human mouth boiling in a soup kettle in Haarmann 's apartment ;

her four children by smothering them during periods of frustration . </s> <s> During a jury replay of Folbigg 's police interview , she attempted to run from the courtroom . </s> <s> The defense made the case that Folbigg did not kill or harm her children and that she did not think that Craig was responsible either . </s> <s> Although prosecution witnesses were concerned about the lack of prodromal ( early-warning ) symptoms in any of the children , the defence posed natural explanations for the events such as cot death and , in the case of Laura 's death , myocarditis . </s> <s> The defence highlighted that Folbigg was a caring mother , pointing to journal entries that showed the care and concern that she gave her children . </s> <s> Some of her acquaintances gave statements to investigators about her caring nature . </s> <s> The defense pointed out that there were no direct admissions to the killings in Folbigg 's journal entries , and that any entries indirectly suggesting her responsibility could be chalked up to a typical grieving mother 's guilt . </s> <s> Folbigg appeared genuinely distraught to ambulance and police responders to the scene . </s> <s> They pointed out that no physical evidence could link Folbigg to murder ; it was an entirely circumstantial case with very little consensus among the scientific experts who testified at trial . </s> <s> On 21 May 2003 , Folbigg was found guilty by the Supreme Court of New South Wales jury of the following crimes : three counts of murder , one count of manslaughter and one count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm . </s> <s> On 24 October 2003 , Folbigg was sentenced to forty years ' imprisonment with a non-parole period of thirty years . </s> <s> On 17 February 2005 , the court reduced her sentence to thirty years ' imprisonment with a non-parole period of twenty-five years on appeal . </s> <s> Due to the nature of her crimes , Folbigg resides in protective custody to prevent possible violence by other inmates . </s> <s> On 22 August 2018 , New South Wales Attorney-General Mark Speakman announced there would be an inquiry into the convictions , to `` ensure public confidence in the administration of justice '' . </s> <s> It was in response to a petition presented by her supporters . </s> <s> `` The petition appears to raise a doubt or question concerning the evidence as to the incidence of reported deaths of three or more infants in the same family attributed to unidentified natural causes in the proceedings leading to Ms Folbigg 's convictions , '' he said . </s> <s> However , in the 500 page report , released in July 2019 , a former chief judge of the District Court found he did not have `` any reasonable doubt as to the guilt of Kathleen Megan Folbigg for the offences of which she was convicted '' . </s> <s> Folbigg 's legal team promptly requested a further judicial review of her case citing `` bias '' during the inquiry . </s> <s> Scott Lee Kimball (

Jennifer Marcum , 25 ; LeAnn Emry , 24 ; and Kimball 's uncle , Terry Kimball , 60 . </s> <s> All four victims died between January 2003 and August 2004 , while Kimball was on `` supervised release '' after a prior check fraud conviction , serving as an FBI informant . </s> <s> Marcum remains missing and is presumed dead , while the other three bodies were recovered in remote Colorado and Utah locations . </s> <s> Kimball has boasted to friends of multiple other murders , but authorities have uncovered no direct evidence corroborating his claims . </s> <s> Kimball was born in Boulder , Colorado . </s> <s> He was convicted of check fraud after stealing over $ 50,000 from an optometrist who shared an office with his mother , an insurance agent . </s> <s> Kimball was sentenced to prison for fraud , but was released in 2003 . </s> <s> His early release came after he convinced FBI agents that he would work for them as an informant . </s> <s> In prison , Kimball had befriended fellow convict Steve Ennis who was allegedly plotting to kill his estranged girlfriend Jennifer Marcum . </s> <s> Given that Marcum was expected to testify in an important trial about a methamphetamine distribution ring , FBI agents agreed to work with Kimball . </s> <s> Kimball went on to kill Marcum and three others . </s> <s> Kimball is currently serving his sentence at Colorado State Penitentiary . </s> <s> In September 2010 , it was reported that the FBI was investigating Kimball as a possible suspect in the murder and mutilation of a woman found in Westminster , Colorado , in October 2004 , while Kimball lived in the area under FBI supervision . </s> <s> In December 2010 , Kimball told a cousin that he had been proposed as a suspect in the West Mesa murders in New Mexico , which were committed during the same 2003-2005 time period . </s> <s> He denied involvement . </s> <s> The CBS News series 48 Hours outlines Kimball 's case in an episode titled `` Hannibal Unmasked '' , originally aired April 2010 . </s> <s> The NBC News series Dateline NBC aired another telling of the Kimball story on September 21 , 2018 , with updates since the CBS version . </s> <s> Joaquín Ferrándiz Ventura ( born 1963 ) is an incarcerated Spanish abductor , rapist and ( later ) serial killer who murdered five women in the Spanish province of Castellón between July 2 , 1995 and September 14 , 1996 . </s> <s> Ferrándiz was born in Valencia , Spain in 1963 . </s> <s> He was the first of three siblings . </s> <s> Ferrándiz 's first crime took place on August 6 , 1989 , when he deliberately ran over an 18-year-old female motorcyclist named María . </s> <s> The crash was non-fatal , but the victim broke her ankle . </s> <s> Ferrándiz exited his car and approached María , feigning apology and inviting her into his vehicle in order , he claimed , to drive her to the hospital . </s> <s> Once inside , he drove her to an isolated area and raped her , before subsequently abandoning her near the hospital . </s> <s> Ferrándiz was identified by another motorist who had witnessed the collision </s> <s> Ferrándiz was arrested and sentenced to fourteen years in prison for this crime . </s> <s> For the duration of his incarceration , he shared his cell with another criminal who had killed his wife . </s> <s> After his release , Ferrándiz would imitate the modus operandi of this cellmate in his own murders . </s> <s> In 1995 , he was paroled following a campaign by his friends and family that claimed his innocence and decried his internment as unjust . </s> <s> His good behavior during his time in prison , when he collaborated in the prison newsletter La Saeta , was cited as a reason for his early release . </s> <s> Upon his excarceration , Ferrándiz moved to Castellón de la Plana with his mother and worked in a car insurance company . </s> <s> His co-workers described him as `` absolutely normal , '' polite and charming . </s> <s> Ferrándiz committed all of his later crimes during weekends , in party areas in and around the city of Castellón . </s> <s> Sonia Rubio Arrufat , a 25-year-old English teacher , was last seen at 5:00 a.m. on the morning of July 2 , 1995 , leaving a Benicàssim disco that she had attended with friends . </s> <s> She intended to walk the one kilometer distance between the disco and her parents apartment in Benicàssim , but she never reached her destination . </s> <s> Her body was found by a motorist on November 20 , hidden in thick bushes near the road between Benicàssim and Oropesa del Mar . </s> <s> She was half-dressed , with her hands tied and her mouth covered with duct tape . </s> <s> The Spanish Civil Guard codenamed the investigation of Rubio 's murder Operación Bola de Cristal ( `` Operation Crystal Ball '' ) . </s> <s> The following year , in September 1996 , 22-year-old Amelia Sandra García Costa disappeared . </s> <s> She , too , was last seen leaving a disco in Castellón . </s> <s> Her half-dressed body , also with her hands tied , was found in a pond of Onda in March 1997 . </s> <s> Her murder was immediately linked to Rubio 's due to the similarities between the victims and the perpetrator 's modus operandi . </s> <s> In February 1998 , Ferrándiz attempted to repeat his 1989 attack on another female motorist , but the victim fought back and escaped after biting his finger . </s> <s> She was able to give police a full description of her attacker , as well as part of his car plate . </s> <s> With this information , the Civil Guard launched an operation to monitor Ferrándiz . </s> <s> They noticed that he regularly visited an area of Castellón called `` Los Cipreses , '' where there was a high concentration of discos and night-clubs , and that whilst there , he acted strangely , as if he was stalking different women in order to identify a potential victim . </s> <s> It is believed that Ferrándiz did not know any of his victims personally , but that he watched them for a long period before striking . </s> <s> Ferrándiz attempted another attack in July 1998 , when he deflated the tyre of a woman 's car before she left a nearby nightclub . </s> <s> The woman suffered a non-fatal car crash , but Ferrándiz could not abduct her as he had intended . </s> <s> This incident was witnessed by plain-clothes Guardia Civil officers , who arrested Ferrándiz in his office a few days later , on July 29 . </s> <s> A parallel search of his home found the roll of duct tape that he had used to gag Sonia Rubio , tying him to the first crime . </s> <s> Ferrándiz initially admitted to the rape of two women , but he denied involvement in any murders . </s> <s> He was charged with Rubio 's abduction , sexual assault and murder . </s> <s> By October 21 , however , he had admitted to killing Rubio , García and three prostitutes whose skeletonized bodies had been found in a riverbank near Vila-real in early 1996 : Natalia Archelos Olaria ( 24 ) , Mercedes Vélez Ayala ( 18 ) , and Francisca Salas León ( 24 ) . </s> <s> These three murders had been investigated as related to each other , but had not been linked to the murders of Rubio or García , and a truck driver had been arrested as a suspect . </s> <s> Several psychiatric evaluations of Ferrándiz diagnosed him as a psychopath . </s> <s> Prosecutors requested 163 years in prison with the recommendation that Ferrándiz be never paroled again , and a fine of 200 million pesetas to compensate the families of all five victims . </s> <s> In addition , they also petitioned that the State be named secondarily responsible for not keeping Ferrándiz under the necessary surveillance after he was excarcerated . </s> <s> On January 14 , 2000 Ferrándiz was found guilty of five counts of murder , one of attempted murder , and another of imprudence resulting in injuries . </s> <s> Ferrándiz was sentenced to 69 years in prison and to compensate the families with 130 million . </s> <s> The State was acquitted . </s> <s> Ferrándiz 's crimes were loosely adapted into a third-season episode of TVE 's crime anthology series La Huella del Crimen , titled El asesino dentro del círculo ( `` The murderer within the circle '' ) . </s> <s> Horst David ( born 22 November 1938 in Breslau ) is a German serial killer . </s> <s> After completing a painter 's apprenticeship as a hired painter , David moved to the Hainsacker district near Regensburg . </s> <s> In 1963 , he married and fathered two sons with his wife . </s> <s> He stayed away from his home for days at a time , instead spending time in Munich and Hamburg ( most likely in other cities too ) , where he would spend lots of money on women . </s> <s> Because of this , his family had financial difficulties . </s> <s> On 22 August 1975 , during one of these trips to Munich , he murdered Waltraud Frank and , two days later , Fatima Grossart . </s> <s> The two prostitutes were strangled and their homes searched . </s> <s> Later , David stated that he quarreled with both victims because they had demanded more money than what was agreed to . </s> <s> After being fired from his job and divorcing his wife , he moved to Regensburg in 1984 and lived on welfare . </s> <s> Eighteen years after the Munich murders , on 7 September 1993 , David 's neighbour , Mathilde Steindl , was strangled in her apartment . </s> <s> The police , who included David as the main suspect in the preliminary investigation , arrested him after his fingerprints were found in the deceased 's apartment . </s> <s> There was no conviction , however , because David was apparently temporarily residing in a neighbour 's apartment . </s> <s> His fingerprints were routinely sent to the Bavarian State Office of Criminal Investigation by the authorities . </s> <s> In 1994 , the then-new Automated Fingerprint Identification System ( AFIS ) made a match with the fingerprints on Fatima Grossart 's body . </s> <s> In the following police investigations , David initially denied being in Munich in August 1975 and visiting any prostitutes . </s> <s> When he was confronted with evidence , he admitted to the murders of the two prostitutes , in addition to several others . </s> <s> As well as his neighbour , he also confessed to the following : </s> <s> The three victims from 1981 to 1984 wanted to hire him as an assistant for the renovation of their homes , but refused to lend him money or pay for the services . </s> <s> Thoss let him borrow 20,000 Deutsche Marks over time . </s> <s> The three murders were n't initially recognised as murders until the confession of Horst David , who arranged them to look like household accidents . </s> <s> David confessed to seven murders . </s> <s> According to the then investigator Josef Wilfling , financial gain also played role in the murders . </s> <s> It is believed that David has committed more murders . </s> <s> Among other things , his unusually high age at the time of his first proven murder , and his day long jogs also contribute to this . </s> <s> Josef Wilfling said that the brief period between the first two murders , the circumstances , and his behaviour would suggest that David already had experience in that area . </s> <s> David was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Regional Court of Munich in December 1995 . </s> <s> To this day he resides in Straubling Prison . </s> <s> The investigation of Fatima Grossart 's murder is regarded as a milestone in German crime history , as it was here for the first time that a 20-year-old crime was resolved with the help of the computer-assisted tracking system of AFIS . </s> <s> Harry T. Hayward ( c. 1865 – December 11 , 1895 ) was an American socialite , gambler , arsonist , and murderer . </s> <s> Due to his ability to manipulate others , the newspapers of the era dubbed Hayward , `` The Minneapolis Svengali , '' `` the most cold-blooded murderer that ever walked God 's footstool '' , and , `` the most bloodthirsty soul ever to usurp the human frame . </s> <s> `` </s> <s> Hayward is best known as the mastermind of one of 19th-century America 's most infamous crimes—the 1894 murder for hire of dressmaker Catherine `` Kitty '' Ging . </s> <s> In the hours before his hanging at Hennepin County Jail in Minneapolis , Hayward gave a detailed interview to his cousin Edward Goodsell and a court reporter . </s> <s> He admitted to numerous arsons , assaults , swindles , and three unsolved murders . </s> <s> Historian and true crime writer Jack El-Hai has written that , if Hayward 's admissions are true , then he predates Dr. H. H. Holmes as America 's first documented serial killer . </s> <s> Harry T. Hayward was born in Macoupin County , Illinois , the son of William and Lodusky Hayward , and was brought to Minneapolis at the age of one year . </s> <s> When he was about six years old , his family briefly returned to Illinois and stayed for about one year . </s> <s> Following his return to Minneapolis , Hayward `` went to a private school conducted by Mrs. Lockwood on Sixth avenue north , and stayed there perhaps six months .
